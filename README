This is supposed to be a game engine

# Goals

- Represent "state" with a purely property-centric model
- have modular components that can do arbitrary operations on that game state
- include something that does "graphics" on a terminal in the shitty ASCII style everyone hates :)
	- but make it possible to swap in a different graphics module by being modular
- build as a dynamically linkable library
- work on Windows, Linux and Mac (I have no idea how to do this)
